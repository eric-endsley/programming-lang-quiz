# Programming Language Quiz

#### A quiz to determine the programming language you should learn, 10/23/20

#### By Eric Endsley

## Description

This webpage contains a quiz with 5 questions, each of which provides 4 radio inputs for the user to select from. Each of the 4 input options for each question correspond to a language-suggestion which will display at the bottom of the page when the button labeled "which language should I learn?' is clicked. Whichever result the user's inputs correspond to most often will be displayed, or in the case of a tie, the tie is broken by an arbitrary hierarchy of priority (javascript result displays with priority over C# result > Ruby result > 'none' result).
